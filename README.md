## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer performance for a hypermarket (Freshco) to uncover business insights related to revenue, profitability, customer behavior, and product performance. The objective was to transform raw retail data into structured analysis to support data-driven business decisions.

## Business Problem  
Freshco operates across multiple regions with a wide range of products and customer segments. The business needed to understand which products, regions, and customer types contribute most to revenue and profit, and where performance gaps exist.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains transactional retail data with key fields including:
- Order ID  
- Order Date  
- Customer Segment  
- Product Category and Sub-Category  
- Sales  
- Profit  
- Quantity  
- Region and City  

The data represents historical sales performance across different business dimensions.

## Key KPIs / Metrics  
- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin  
- Average Order Value  
- Sales by Category and Sub-Category  
- Sales by Region and City  
- Customer Segment Performance  

## Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Pivot Charts  
- Power Query (basic data cleaning)  
- Excel formulas for KPI calculations  

## Exploratory Questions  
1. What is the overall sales and profit performance of Freshco?  
2. Which product categories and sub-categories generate the highest revenue and profit?  
3. Which regions and cities contribute most to sales?  
4. How do different customer segments impact revenue?  
5. Which products are underperforming?  
6. What trends exist in sales over time?

## Analysis & Approach  
- Cleaned and validated the dataset for missing and inconsistent values.  
- Created pivot tables to analyze sales and profit across multiple dimensions.  
- Used aggregation and filtering to compare category-wise and region-wise performance.  
- Built summary tables and charts to visualize business KPIs.  

## Key Insights  
- A small number of product categories drive the majority of total revenue.  
- Certain sub-categories show high sales but low profitability, indicating cost issues.  
- Urban regions contribute most of the revenue compared to rural regions.  
- Corporate and Consumer segments generate higher sales than other segments.  
- Some products consistently underperform and may require discontinuation or repositioning.  

## Business Recommendations  
- Focus marketing and inventory on high-performing categories and regions.  
- Review pricing or cost structure for low-profit sub-categories.  
- Optimize product portfolio by removing or improving underperforming products.  
- Target high-value customer segments with personalized offers.  

## Outcome / Business Impact  
This analysis enables Freshco to improve strategic decision-making by identifying revenue drivers, optimizing product mix, and enhancing customer targeting, ultimately supporting higher profitability and operational efficiency.
